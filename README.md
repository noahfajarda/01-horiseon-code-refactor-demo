## Description

This project is an attempt to refactor the HTML and CSS of the "Horiseon" homepage. Some of the changes the HTML included were to specify semantic elements and utilize unified classes. Some of the changes the CSS included were to convert classes to existing HTML tags, specify sematic elements, organize the layout to find easily accesible elements, minimize repetition, and to compartmentalize similar classes.
